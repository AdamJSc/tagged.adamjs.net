Hej hej! 👋

Thanks for ending up here.

It's largely an attempt to respond to various "give-us-your-list" style social media posts that I've been tagged in
recently - the idea being that I appear marginally-less ignorant to the OP without needing to sell my soul to
"the man and his algos" in the process (because that definitely hasn't already happened yet).

Plus it gave me another excuse to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which I quite enjoyed last time and I don't get 
a lot of opportunity to front-end dev these days 👍

I might add some of my own too over time, because I've now gone to all the trouble of setting up.

Anyway, OK...
