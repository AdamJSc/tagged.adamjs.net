Hej hej! üëã

Thanks for ending up here.

It's not much to look at - largely an attempt to respond to various "give-us-your-list" style social media posts that
I've been tagged in recently.

The original idea was to appear marginally-less ignorant to the OP by providing my list, without needing to upload to
the platforms in question and sell my soul to "the man and his algos" in the process (because that definitely hasn't
already happened yet).

Plus, it gave me another excuse to build something using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which I quite enjoyed working
with last time and I don't get a lot of opportunity to do the front-end dev these days (it's honestly better that way...
for everyone... as the "design" of this microsite will testify üëç).

I might end up adding some of my own lists over time as well, since I've now gone to all the effort of setting this thing up.

Anyway...
