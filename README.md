This is a small hobbyist microsite for housing responses to various "give us your list"-style social media posts.

Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so I could muster a rusty attempt at some super basic front-end dev with
a super nice-to-use static-site generator.

Hosted using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

## Requirements

* Jekyll 4.0.1

## Run locally

Follow the Jekyll [installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), then run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```
